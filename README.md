# MAS-Land
A simulated society made up of autonomous agents that learn how to interact with one another by classifying their experiences with individually trained machine learning statistical classifiers.

### From the Paper - 1.1 Initial Concepts:

*"MAS-Land is a 2D world where autonomous beings with different attributes roam around living their lives. The world moves in steps, and every step, each being decides on which direction it wants to go next. Their decisions are never due to a hard-coded preference, but rather, their understanding of their past experiences. When they are subjected to an event they file away the eventâ€™s features, the outcome of it, and the overall sentiment of the interaction. Once it gains enough experience of the world, their decisions will be determined by searching back through their experiences and assessing the most beneficial action. The aim is that the beings will learn their place in the world and how they should interact with one another."*
